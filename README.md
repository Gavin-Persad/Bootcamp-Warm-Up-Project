# Bootcamp-Warm-Up-Project
Hi All, 
This is a practise space for me to work on HTML, CSS and get used to using Git Hub


The Plan - AirBnB.co.uk Copy
1. create index and style sheets
2. create divs for all sections
3. add links to category and listing sections
4. add divs to page footer section
5. add images to categories and listings
6. add images to search and rising footer
7. shape search and filter and add border in css
8. create scroll bar for caterories and size correctly
9. create grid layout for listings and add text
10. add scroll for footer scroll
11. add text and grids for footer
12. add styles to rising footer
13. make rising footer and top sections stick 
14. polish sizing and layout


The outcome
It took a few sessions to get used to using git hub.
At first I was not creating branches. I was able to work this out step at a time over a few sessions.

I tried to do all HTML work first then move onto CSS. This was not ideal. I was left with a lot of errors that were copied multiple times.
I needed to go through and correct them all indiviually. This was time consuming.
I should have worked on both together to create a template. Then copied and pasted this once I was happy with it.

I also tried to use H1 - H7. To find H7 didn't exist. I was also using this incorrectly.
I changed most to Ps or Divs and began to make more use of classes to be able to edit.
This also led me to find that highlighting sections and hitting tab would indent the whole section.
Learning this sooner could have helped save some time.

I learnt about SVGs and also learnt later that I shouldn't include Xmlns. I was able to remove a lot of image syntax and replace this with SVGs. This was again time consuming and something that should have been avoided.

I thought that creating the border for the search bar and the scrolls for catergories would take a while. This was actually very simple. The main time consuming work here was ensuring that things were correctly sized using padding and margins.

I often had to go back to my index file and make changes to be able to edit items either together or seperately. I feel this was mainly due to lack of experienc and would feel more confident when planning a project like this again.

My main problem was creating layouts. This was mainly due to poor planning and lack of experience.
Having created all divs first, I needed to go back and make lots of edits. This also led to some styles leading into other sections where they were not planned to be used.
